# Assignment1

The dataset used is 'mtcars' dataset, with subset of this dataset whose mpg is smaller than 20. The considered variables are mpg, cyl, disp, hp and gears. 

The two plots respectively show the relationship between disp and mpg and the relationship between cyl and mpg.

From this simple exploration, I learned how to use github and how to manage my code.
